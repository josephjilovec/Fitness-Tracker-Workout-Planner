Fitness Tracker System Architecture
Overview
Fitness Tracker is a full-stack web application designed to help users track workouts, manage fitness goals, and engage in social interactions like posts, comments, and challenges. Built with a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend, it uses MongoDB for data storage, JWT for authentication, and Chart.js for visualizations. The system is containerized with Docker and deployable on AWS, ensuring scalability and reliability. This document details the architecture, component interactions, and design decisions, with a Mermaid diagram illustrating the data flow.
System Components
1. Backend (Node.js/Express, MongoDB)
Purpose: Handles data storage, API logic, authentication, and social features.

Key Files:

backend/index.js: Main server setup, connects to MongoDB via Mongoose, enables CORS, and mounts routes.
backend/models/:
User.js: Schema for user data (username, password, profile, achievements).
Workout.js: Schema for workouts (title, exercises, duration, calories, userId).
Exercise.js: Schema for exercises (name, muscleGroup, equipment, media).


backend/routes/:
users.js: Handles user registration and login with bcrypt and JWT.
workouts.js: Manages CRUD operations for workouts and stats aggregation.
exercises.js: Manages CRUD operations and search for exercises.
social.js: Handles posts, comments, likes, and challenges.


backend/middleware/auth.js: JWT authentication middleware for protected routes.


Implementation:

Node.js/Express: Provides RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and social interactions.
Mongoose: Manages MongoDB schemas and queries.
bcrypt: Hashes passwords for secure storage.
jsonwebtoken: Generates and verifies JWTs for authentication.
MongoDB: Stores user data, workouts, exercises, and social content.



2. Frontend (React, Chart.js)
Purpose: Delivers an interactive UI for managing workouts, profiles, and social features.

Key Files:

frontend/src/App.js: Main React app with React Router for navigation.
frontend/src/components/:
Navbar.js: Navigation bar with links to all views.
Dashboard.js: Displays workout history, recent activities, and goals.
WorkoutPlanner.js: Creates, edits, and schedules workouts with a calendar.
ExerciseLibrary.js: Searchable exercise database with filters.
UserProfile.js: Manages user details and displays achievements.
DataVisualization.js: Shows workout stats (duration, calories) with Chart.js.
SocialFeed.js: Displays posts, comments, likes, and challenges.


frontend/src/styles/tailwind.css: Custom Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
frontend/src/index.js: React entry point, renders App.js.


Implementation:

React: Builds reusable components with React Router for client-side routing.
axios: Makes API requests to the backend, protected by JWT.
Chart.js: Visualizes workout stats in line charts.
react-calendar: Provides a calendar for scheduling workouts.
Tailwind CSS: Ensures a responsive, fitness-focused UI.



3. Deployment
Purpose: Ensures the app is scalable and accessible via cloud platforms.

Key Files:

deploy/Dockerfile: Containerizes the Node.js backend and React frontend.
deploy/package.json: Lists backend dependencies and scripts.
deploy/aws_config.yml: Configures AWS Elastic Beanstalk with auto-scaling.
.github/workflows/ci.yml: Automates testing and deployment.


Implementation:

Docker: Packages the app for consistent environments.
AWS: Deploys to EC2 with S3 for static assets and auto-scaling for load handling.
MongoDB Atlas: Optional cloud-hosted MongoDB for production.

Data Flow Explanation

Frontend Requests: The React frontend (App.js) routes users to components (Dashboard.js, WorkoutPlanner.js, etc.) via React Router. Components use axios to make authenticated API calls with JWT stored in localStorage.
Backend Processing: The Express backend (index.js) routes requests to appropriate handlers (users.js, workouts.js, etc.). The auth.js middleware verifies JWTs before processing protected routes.
Data Storage: Mongoose interacts with MongoDB to store and retrieve user profiles, workouts, exercises, and social data. Schemas (User.js, Workout.js, Exercise.js) enforce data integrity.
Social Features: social.js manages posts, comments, likes, and challenges, stored in MongoDB collections defined inline.
Visualization: DataVisualization.js fetches aggregated stats from /api/workouts/stats and renders line charts with Chart.js.
Deployment: The Docker container (deploy/Dockerfile) packages the backend and built frontend, deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk with S3 for static assets (e.g., exercise media).

Design Decisions

Modularity: Backend routes and frontend components are separated for maintainability and scalability.
Security: JWT authentication protects sensitive routes; bcrypt hashes passwords.
Performance: MongoDB indexes (implicit via Mongoose) and efficient queries optimize data retrieval.
Responsive UI: Tailwind CSS ensures a mobile-friendly, fitness-focused design.
Scalability: Docker and AWS auto-scaling handle varying user loads.
Testing: Mocha/Chai for backend and Jest for frontend ensure >80% test coverage.
Open-Source: MIT license encourages community contributions.

Future Improvements

Add real-time notifications for social interactions using WebSockets.
Implement advanced analytics (e.g., workout trends, predictive goals) with machine learning.
Support file uploads for exercise media to S3.
Enhance leaderboard in SocialFeed.js with dynamic rankings based on user activity.

This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and user-friendly fitness tracking solution, suitable for deployment and further development.
